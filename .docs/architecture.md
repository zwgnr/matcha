# Architecture

Matcha runs as a **Node.js WebSocket server** that wraps `codex app-server` (JSON-RPC over stdio) and serves a React web app.

## Components

- **Browser app**: The React app renders session state, owns the client-side WebSocket transport, and treats typed push events as the boundary between server runtime details and UI state.

- **Server**: `apps/server` is the main coordinator. It serves the web app, accepts WebSocket requests, waits for startup readiness before welcoming clients, and sends all outbound pushes through a single ordered push path.

- **Provider runtime**: `codex app-server` does the actual provider/session work. The server talks to it over JSON-RPC on stdio and translates those runtime events into the app's orchestration model.

- **Background workers**: Long-running async flows such as runtime ingestion, command reaction, and checkpoint processing run as queue-backed workers. This keeps work ordered, reduces timing races, and gives tests a deterministic way to wait for the system to go idle.

- **Runtime signals**: The server emits lightweight typed receipts when important async milestones finish, such as checkpoint capture, diff finalization, or a turn becoming fully quiescent. Tests and orchestration code wait on these signals instead of polling internal state.

## Event Lifecycle

### Startup and client connect

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser
    participant Transport as WsTransport
    participant Server as wsServer
    participant Layers as serverLayers
    participant Ready as ServerReadiness
    participant Push as ServerPushBus

    Browser->>Transport: Load app and open WebSocket
    Transport->>Server: Connect
    Server->>Layers: Start runtime services
    Server->>Ready: Wait for startup barriers
    Ready-->>Server: Ready
    Server->>Push: Publish server.welcome
    Push-->>Transport: Ordered welcome push
    Transport-->>Browser: Hydrate initial state
```

1. The browser boots [`WsTransport`][1] and registers typed listeners in [`wsNativeApi`][2].
2. The server accepts the connection in [`wsServer`][3] and brings up the runtime graph defined in [`serverLayers`][7].
3. [`ServerReadiness`][4] waits until the key startup barriers are complete.
4. Once the server is ready, [`wsServer`][3] sends `server.welcome` from the contracts in [`ws.ts`][6] through [`ServerPushBus`][5].
5. The browser receives that ordered push through [`WsTransport`][1], and [`wsNativeApi`][2] uses it to seed local client state.

### User turn flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser
    participant Transport as WsTransport
    participant Server as wsServer
    participant Provider as ProviderService
    participant Codex as codex app-server
    participant Ingest as ProviderRuntimeIngestion
    participant Engine as OrchestrationEngine
    participant Push as ServerPushBus

    Browser->>Transport: Send user action
    Transport->>Server: Typed WebSocket request
    Server->>Provider: Route request
    Provider->>Codex: JSON-RPC over stdio
    Codex-->>Ingest: Provider runtime events
    Ingest->>Engine: Normalize into orchestration events
    Engine-->>Server: Domain events
    Server->>Push: Publish orchestration.domainEvent
    Push-->>Browser: Typed push
```

1. A user action in the browser becomes a typed request through [`WsTransport`][1] and the browser API layer in [`nativeApi`][12].
2. [`wsServer`][3] decodes that request using the shared WebSocket contracts in [`ws.ts`][6] and routes it to the right service.
3. [`ProviderService`][8] starts or resumes a session and talks to `codex app-server` over JSON-RPC on stdio.
4. Provider-native events are pulled back into the server by [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][9], which converts them into orchestration events.
5. [`OrchestrationEngine`][10] persists those events, updates the read model, and exposes them as domain events.
6. [`wsServer`][3] pushes those updates to the browser through [`ServerPushBus`][5] on channels defined in [`orchestration.ts`][11].

### Async completion flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Server as wsServer
    participant Worker as Queue-backed workers
    participant Cmd as ProviderCommandReactor
    participant Checkpoint as CheckpointReactor
    participant Receipt as RuntimeReceiptBus
    participant Push as ServerPushBus
    participant Browser

    Server->>Worker: Enqueue follow-up work
    Worker->>Cmd: Process provider commands
    Worker->>Checkpoint: Process checkpoint tasks
    Checkpoint->>Receipt: Publish completion receipt
    Cmd-->>Server: Produce orchestration changes
    Checkpoint-->>Server: Produce orchestration changes
    Server->>Push: Publish resulting state updates
    Push-->>Browser: User-visible push
```

1. Some work continues after the initial request returns, especially in [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][9], [`ProviderCommandReactor`][13], and [`CheckpointReactor`][14].
2. These flows run as queue-backed workers using [`DrainableWorker`][16], which helps keep side effects ordered and test synchronization deterministic.
3. When a milestone completes, the server emits a typed receipt on [`RuntimeReceiptBus`][15], such as checkpoint completion or turn quiescence.
4. Tests and orchestration code wait on those receipts instead of polling git state, projections, or timers.
5. Any user-visible state changes produced by that async work still go back through [`wsServer`][3] and [`ServerPushBus`][5].
